<a href="#41-es6-status-report"><h2 id="41-es6-status-report">4.1 ES6 Status Report</h2></a><p>(Allen Wirfs-Brock)</p>
<p>AWB: Draft published, Revision 16</p>
<ul>
<li>Backed out the Symbols as non-wrapper types from Revision 15</li>
<li>Section items renumbered for clarity</li>
<li>Want to re-org/re-order the entire document
<ul>
<li>Primarily re-order the lexical grammar and syntax (currently out of order by 3 sections)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>LH: (asked for motivation)</p>
<p>WH: Noticed...</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed for-in to disallow left side assignment expression.</li>
<li>Syntax for arrow doesn't propagate the NoIn-ness of grammar rule. A NoIn arrow grammar production expands into a seqence that ends with a non-NoIn expression.
If we hadn't changed for-in to disallow left side initializers, this would break the grammar by allowing in's to leak into a NoIn expression.
However, we have changed for-in to disallow left side initializers. Given that, the regular/NoIn syntax rule bifurcation is now pointless. We have an opportunity to simplify and regularize the grammar here.</li>
</ul>
<p>AWB: Will look into removing the NoIn productions.</p>
<p>LH: This was discussed recently on es-discuss
(need reference)</p>
<p>AWB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further rationalization of alphabetizing Chapter 15</li>
<li>Reminder that people should use the bug tracker for spec revision issues.</li>
<li>Implementor feedback will be prioritized</li>
</ul>
<p>LH: Re: initializer argument with an &quot;entries&quot; property will be used to create the entries in the Map (7.a)</p>
<p>&quot;Let hasValues be the result of HasProperty(iterable, &quot;entries&quot;).&quot;</p>
<p>AWB: Explains the rationale of creating a new map from an existing map</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> m1 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Map</span>();
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> m2 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Map</span>(m1);
</code></pre>
<p>LH/DH/YK/RW: Should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> m1 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Map</span>();
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> m2 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Map</span>(m1.entries());
</code></pre>
<p>EA: Should just use <code>@@iterator</code>, which is <code>entries</code>, but without explicitly checking for a property called <code>entries</code>.</p>
<p>DH: Advocate for uniform API, test for existance, assumes it's iterable, 2 element array-likes and initialize.</p>
<p>MM: Have we decided on the convention that an iterator of X is also an interable of X. A map.entries() gives you an iterator.</p>
<p>YK: map is already an iterable</p>
<p>DH: Should make sense to pass an iterator to Map</p>
<p>AWB: All the built in iterators are also iterables</p>
<p>DH: Agree, though this has been debated</p>
<p>WH: What happens...</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Map</span>([ <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"defg"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"hi"</span> ]);
<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Map</span>([{ <span class="hljs-number">1</span>: <span class="hljs-number">10</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>: <span class="hljs-number">20</span> }]);
</code></pre>
<p>BE: The first one makes a map mapping &quot;a&quot; → &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot; → &quot;e&quot;, &quot;h&quot; → &quot;i&quot;. The second one makes a map of 20 → 10.</p>
<p>AWB: The algorithm for Map should check for entries to be Object</p>
<p>DH:</p>
<p>MM: I don't think we should special case for string</p>
<p>AR: Agree, but not with example</p>
<p>MM: Making a special case for String seems like an odd decision</p>
<p>AR: In the case of i18n where we can't change the code point... you can imagine having a string map, but if I can just pass in a string.</p>
<p>... Don't object, just exploring</p>
<p>AWB: Objecting. What use case can you imagine where programmers intend for strngs to be array-like?</p>
<p>MM: None reasonable</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>MM: Question about value objects. If the value object responds to Get(0) or Get(1)</p>
<p>WH: with Mark, don't want special tests for different types</p>
<p>LH: If I do...</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Map</span>([ <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span> ]);
</code></pre>
<p>I will get <code>undefined, undefined, undefined</code>, which is a stronger case for making the check</p>
<p>DH: +1</p>
<p>WH: Elsewhere, we've gone to detect duplicate errors</p>
<p>AWB: Checking for duplicates will duplicate the cost</p>
<p>MM: The impl of any hash table will require a test for duplicate keys</p>
<p>AWB: What about key, values that have been collected over time?</p>
<p>MM: There are use cases for duplicate key checks</p>
<p>LH: Historically, we make duplicate checks when it's syntactic, and this is the first time we're trying to apply duplicate checks to runtime semantics</p>
<p>MM: If something you didn't expect happens once, i'd much prefer an error</p>
<p>YK/RW: That's bad for the web</p>
<p>RW: Map would become a &quot;try/catch&quot; case</p>
<p>... mixed discussion about the precedent for loud or quiet handling</p>
<p>WH: Are there any other constructor that throw when created &quot;incorrectly&quot;?</p>
<p>RW: In non-strict mode, a program can create an object with all duplicate keys and never fail in production</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>MM:</p>
<p>AC: Creation can be what is the least requirement for what it takes to create a map. Taking an arbitrary structure and make a map and it's perfectly good semantics to</p>
<p>LH/MM: Offline conversation about what qualifies for extra defense.</p>
<p>DH: Select cases where there is easy to argue that there few legitimate uses, ok to have occassion sanity tests. In general, JavaScript does not go out of it's way to provide you with defensive mechanisms. It's hard to predict where people are going to get hurt, better to allow them to decide.</p>
<p>WH: Paying for consequences where <code>with</code> doesn't protect against collisions.</p>
<p>AWB: Try to apply my model when writing these algorithms, please try to read the algorithms when they are published</p>
<a href="#consensusresolution-41-es6-status-report"><h4 id="consensusresolution-41-es6-status-report"><del>Consensus/Resolution</del></h4></a><ul>
<li><p>Map contructor, accepts optional initializer</p></li>
<li><p>If initializer undefined, creates an empty map</p></li>
<li><p>If initializer defined, invoke the @@iterator to create the entries from.</p>

<li>For each entry, check if non-null object, throw if not (If Type(map) is not Object then, throw a TypeError exception.)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>UNRESOLVED</strong></p>
<p>AWB: Will put a note in the spec: &quot;Unresolved: how to handle duplicate keys&quot;</p>
<p>WH: Don't yet have consensus on how to handle duplicates, would like to discuss computed properties</p>
<a href="#43-arrayprototypevalues"><h2 id="43-arrayprototypevalues">4.3 Array.prototype.values</h2></a><p>(Allen Wirfs-Brock, Rick Waldron)</p>
<p>AWB: Ext.js uses a <code>with(...) {}</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">f</span>(<span class="hljs-params">values</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span>(values) {
    ...
  }
}

f([]);
</code></pre>
<p>YK: Means that we can't add common names for common objects?</p>
<p>RW: ...Explained that Ext.js fixed the issues, but face a commercial customer update challenge. In the meantime, it continues to break several large scale sites.</p>
<p>AWB: Brendan's workaround (from post on the list)</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">values() -&gt; @@values();
keys() -&gt; @@keys();
entries() -&gt; @@entries();
</code></pre>
<p>Importing from a module...</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">values() -&gt; values([]);
keys() -&gt; keys([]);
entries() -&gt; entries([]);
</code></pre>
<p>DH: Warming up to the idea of a general purpose protocol, implement your map-like protocol.</p>
<p>WH: But now you need an <code>import</code></p>
<p>EA/AR/DH: Web breaking... but why not break</p>
<p>AR: Meta property, [[withinvisible]]</p>
<p>(Way too much support for this)</p>
<p>DH: This idea is fantastic</p>
<p>EA: Very useful to the DOM, may not need another bit on the object, maybe just a &quot;whitelist&quot;.</p>
<p>MM: A very small list of names that &quot;with&quot; doesn't intercept</p>
<p>YK: Could, but semantically almost the same thing</p>
<p>EA: But without the extra bit on all objects</p>
<p>MM: Don't want to require a new bit for all objects.</p>
<p>DH: Need to fully explore the effects on the rest of the language..</p>
<ul>
<li>Blacklist for just Array or all objects?</li>
</ul>
<p>EA: A blacklist that exists, string names, when you enter <code>with(){}</code>, the blacklist must be checked.</p>
<p>MM: If the base object is Array, if the name is on the whitelist</p>
<p>EA: Have an instanceof check? This problem happens in the DOM with Node</p>
<p>EA/YK/AR: We can actually use this for several use cases.</p>
<p>EA: The issue needs instanceof to check the prototype chain.</p>
<p>AWB: For objects you want to treat this way.</p>
<p>DH: The middle ground...</p>
<p>@@withinvisible, well known symbol</p>
<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="hljs-built_in">Array</span>.prototype[ @@withinvisible ] = [

<p>WH/MM/RW/YK: <strong>actual clapping</strong></p>
<p>... Mixed discussion about performance. General agreement that penalties for using <code>with</code> is ok.</p>
<p>AWB: Code may override this, but at their own risk. For example</p>

<p>AWB: In March, we agreed to add refutable pattern matching; began working on adding this to destructuring and realized the work involved would be too great, considering the time frame remaining for ES6.</p>
<p>Propose to defer refutable pattern matching.</p>
<p>(whiteboard)</p>
<p>The current spec would attempt to do a ToObject(10); and would throw:</p>

<p>YK: Removing the question mark breaks the consensus.</p>
<p>AVK: Is it hard to spec the &quot;?&quot; on the outside? Allowing only one level?</p>

<p>YK/AWB: It's easy to do in the grammar</p>
<p>LH: What was in the spec, solved 80% of the cases, we moved to a solution for 100% and this will set us back to 20%, which isn't acceptable.</p>
<p>AWB: What happens at the parameter list level?</p>
<p>YK: Ah, there is no place to put the out &quot;?&quot;</p>

<p>AC: The fail soft is consistent with JS behaviour. If you want something stricter, then the problem should be on the right side, not the left side. Otherwise you need to introduce an operator for the left.</p>
<p>AWB: (reads back conversation from Andreas)</p>
<p>DH/YK: He doesn't seem to say anything about returning to fail soft.</p>
<p>LH: I think we've exhausted the conversation</p>
<p>WH: If we don't do it now, the behavior of refutable and regular rules will be inconsistent in the future; i.e., a trivial refutable rule that doesn't actually make use of the refutable features will behave inconsistently with a textually identical nonrefutable rule.</p>
<p>YK: But you'll be able to opt-in to the full set of &quot;refutables&quot;</p>
<p>WH: I think it's uglifying the future.</p>
<p>YK/LH: It is.</p>
<p>DH: There is precendence in Mozilla's destructuring, that doesnt have refutable matching.</p>
<p>LH: If we added the bang which is the strict mode for this and adds the bang in front, opts in.</p>
<p>AWB: The next part...</p>
<p>WH: The string example:</p>

<p>YK: We agreed <code>new String()</code> solves the problem, if that's what you actually wanted to do.</p>

<p>MM: The one issue about Function toString, discovered since the strawman was written:</p>
<p>Since eval()uating a function declaration or function expression defaults to non-strict, a strict function must present the source code of its body as beginning with a “use strict” directive, even if the original function inherited its strictness from its context. This is the one case where the original local source code of the function is inadequate to satisfy this spec.</p>

<p>DH: Introduces need for 64bit float =&gt; 32bit float and projecting back into 64bit float. If we had a way to coerce into 32bit</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be simulated with TypedArray (put in a value, coerced, pull out)</li>
<li>To have a toFloat32</li>
</ul>
<p>EA: Does JSIDL Need this?</p>
<p>YK: Not that I know of</p>
<p>MM: The real number it designates is a number that is designatable as 64bit</p>
<p>DH: (confirms) If you have a coercion, the implementation could do a 32bit operation</p>
<p>WH: Note that for this to work, you must religiously coerce the result of every suboperation to float32. You can't combine operators such as adding three numbers together.</p>
<p>Given
x, y, z are all float32 values stored as regular ECMAScript doubles, the expressions</p>
<p>x+y+z
float32(x+y+z)
float32(float32(x+y)+z)</p>
<p>can all produce different results. Here's an example:</p>
<p>x = 1;
y = 1e-10;
z = -1;</p>
<p>Computing x+y+z using float32 arithmetic would result in 0. Computing float32(x+y+z) would not.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a very useful property that holds between float32 and float64 (but not between two numeric types in general such as float64 and float80), which is that, for the particular case of float32 and float64, DOUBLE ROUNDING is ok:</p>
<p>Given x, y are float32 values, the following identity holds, where +_32 is the ieee single-precision addition and +_64 is the ieee double-precision addition:</p>
<p>float32(x +_64 y) === x +_32 y</p>
<p>And similarly for -, *, /, and sqrt.</p>
<p>Note that this does not hold in general for arbitrary type pairs.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how DOUBLE ROUNDING can fail for other type pairs. Suppose that we're working in decimal (the issues are the same, I'm just using decimal for presentation reasons), and we compute a sum using arithmetic that has four decimal places and then round it to store it into a type that has two decimal places.</p>
<p>Let's say that the sum x+y is mathematically equal to 2.49495.
2.49495 (mathematically exact sum)</p>
<p>Then we get:
2.4950 (properly rounded result of invoking + on the wider 4-decimal place type)
2.50 (rounded again by coercion to narrower 2-decimal place type)</p>
<p>Yet, if we had invoked + on the narrower 2-decimal place type, we'd instead have gotten the result:
2.49 (mathematically exact sum rounded to narrower 2-decimal place type)</p>
<p>AWB: Is the proposal to expose a toFloat32?</p>
<p>DH: Yes and the Math object seems like the obvious place</p>
<p>RH: Also, toFloat16</p>
<p>DH: Long term, the solution will be value objects, but in the near term, this will have benefit much more quickly</p>
<p>WH: Found evidence that the optimizations are safe as long as the wider type is at least double the width of the narrower type plus two more bits: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html</a> . This is the case for the float32/float64 pair (they're 24 and 53 bits wide respectively), but not in general.</p>
