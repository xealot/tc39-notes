<a href="#44-follow-up-instantiation-reform-create"><h2 id="44-follow-up-instantiation-reform-create">4.4 Follow up: Instantiation Reform (@@create)</h2></a><p>JM: Found cases where we set up state before calling super. I'm convinced that there are sufficient workarounds (via calling &lt;<SuperClass>&gt;.call() in the legacy style).</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/jeffmo/bf30e7154ab3c894b740">https://gist.github.com/jeffmo/bf30e7154ab3c894b740</a> -- &quot;#_Before.js&quot; is an example of a pattern that exists now, &quot;#_After.js&quot; is an example of how one might fix this pattern</p>
<p>JM: (gives examples that amount to two step initialization)</p>
<p>WH: C++ doesn't allow this kind of bottom-up construction (can't initialize a subclass instance before the superclass instance is initialized), and use cases like this arise once in a while. The usual workaround is to pass through Options objects.</p>
<p>JM: (example of type ahead classes in FB code base -- see 2_Before.js and 3_Before.js in the above gist)</p>
<p>AWB: (draws model of two phase allocation)</p>
<p>YK: The problem is allocatuion vs. initialization, in your model mutates before calling super.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to make sure the allocation has happened before you get into the constructor.</li>
<li>It looks like the only way to fix this is to have &quot;two constructors&quot;, which we can't do</li>
</ul>
<p>SB: We don't want to support this pattern, but there is nothing to stop user code from doing this.</p>
<p>AWB: &quot;Fragile Base Class Problem&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Start at derived class</li>
<li>super'ed up to base class</li>
<li>Base class invokes method that's defined on the subclass</li>
<li>The problem is that the object isn't set up yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a bug.</p>
<p>AWB/YK: (Further discussion of how to avoid this pattern)</p>
<p>JM: Special case refactoring in subclasses isn't trivial.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both direction have down side:
<ul>
<li>TDZ approach negates certain cases</li>
<li>Non-TDZ approach allows for decoupling of allocation/instantiation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>YK: Lifting the TDZ doesn't solve the problem. It happens to work in this case because the base class doesn't allocate.</p>
<p>AWB: There is way to do this in the new design, use the construct method</p>
<p>SM: Foresee a tooling solution (e.g. linting for properly placed calls to super())</p>
<p>AWB: Will always come to a place where a problem can't be solved with your existing inheritance model and you'll simply need to refactor. It's not that inheritance has failed, just that the class heirarchy needs to be refactored.</p>
<p>JM/SM: Refactoring is the correct approach, but it can be idealistic in some scenarios. Imagine a TypeaheadBase class that has been subclassed 100s of times. It's not until the 101th time that you realize you need to refactor the base class (and, thus, all pre-existing subclasses)</p>
<p>Discussion about subclasses that require two phase construction (with instance side initialization methods)</p>
<p>Mixed discussion about allocation phases.</p>
<p>MM: Do we have consensus on the instantiation reform we agreed to yesterday?</p>
<p>yes.</p>
<p>[JM agrees on the grounds that there are at least legacy style workarounds for that 101th subclass and the rest of the patterns he found a la <code>&lt;&lt;SuperClass&gt;&gt;.call()</code>]</p>
<p>YK: will not be ok with this solution if it switches on the instantiation of the constructor</p>
<p>...Need help covering this...</p>
<p>WH: I insisted on having a syntactic switch for function-vs-generator rather than switching on the presence of a yield. The reason was that functions and generators are radically different and it makes sense for a trivial generator to have no yields. In this case I'd mildly prefer to have a syntactic switch as well, but it's not as crucial because I haven't seen any good examples of where apparently problem-free code would unexpectedly go wrong. If you don't call the superclass constructor, you'll miss out on superclass initialization, which would be a problem even if the presence of a super call didn't statically switch modes, so the mode switch hasn't created a problem where there wasn't one. Inserting or deleting an &quot;if (false) super()&quot; does change things, but I don't see why one would be likely to do that. [I suppose that you could stylistically mark inheriting constructors whose super() calls are deeply buried with an &quot;if (false) super()&quot; at the top :).]</p>
<p>MM: I agree there is a smell with super; would I adopt syntactic marking? I want to see them first.</p>
<p>WH: On the fence, suppose we do this, what if you call super in a method not marked? What does that do?</p>
<p>DH: It's ok for class body to have more syntactic distinctions than outside functions acting as constructor</p>
<p>AWB: You could imagine that I have a splat that indicates &quot;I do not want allocation for this class&quot;</p>

<li>Agreement to MM proposal: Allen to be the champion and work out the details remaining</li>
</ul>
<a href="#es7-items"><h2 id="es7-items">ES7 Items?</h2></a><p>DH: We should focus on ES6 items, we have limited time in face to face.</p>
<p>DD: I don't think we should de-prioritize ES7, given the train model.</p>
<p>AWB: We have no choice but to prioritize ES6</p>
<a href="#57-arrayprototypecontains"><h2 id="57-arrayprototypecontains">5.7 Array.prototype.contains</h2></a><p>(Domenic Denicola)</p>
<p>Follow up from RW's Stage 0 in</p>
<p>DD: Presents: <a href="https://github.com/domenic/Array.prototype.contains/">https://github.com/domenic/Array.prototype.contains/</a></p>
<p>DH/RW: Parity with String</p>
<p>RW: Most arguments were noise and Domenic's proposal addresses them all.</p>
<p>AWB: One of the previous objections: string.contains is looking for a substring, not an element.</p>
<p>EA: Same thing with indexOf</p>
<p>JM: Can you give an example where this is a problem?</p>
<p>MM: Consistently inconsistent parity with indexOf</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-57-arrayprototypecontains"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-57-arrayprototypecontains">Conclusion/Resolution</h4></a><ul>
<li>Advance to Stage 1</li>
</ul>
<p>DD: Would like to do Stage 2 and 3 asynchronously due to the simplicitly of this proposal.</p>
<p>AWB: I'd like the process to be respected.</p>
<p>MM: If Stage 2, 3, and 4 are complete by next meeting, then we can advance to Stage 4.</p>
<p>Discussion re: the ES7 process.</p>
<p>AWB: Concerns about lack of review that results in more work later in the game.</p>
<p>MM: We don't have a mechanism to come to consensus outside of these meetings. These meetings <em>are</em> the time that we're able to work on these issues. This is my allocated time</p>
<a href="#51-mathtau"><h2 id="51-mathtau">5.1 Math.TAU</h2></a><p>(Brendan Eich, Rick Waldron)</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/rwaldron/233fd8f5aa440c94e6e9">https://gist.github.com/rwaldron/233fd8f5aa440c94e6e9</a></p>
<p>BE: Math.TAU = 2PI</p>
<p>WH: OK, but only if it's called Math.τ :-)</p>
<p>MM: Opposed: one letter shorter, not well known, not well taught. PI is known, taught and ubiquitous.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-51-mathtau"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-51-mathtau">Conclusion/Resolution</h4></a><ul>
<li>Rejected.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#exponentiations-operator"><h2 id="exponentiations-operator">Exponentiations operator</h2></a><p>(Rick Waldron)</p>

<p>RW: All other languages have it. Why can't we?</p>
<p>RW: Needs hihger precedence than multiplication</p>
<p>MM: Right associative?</p>
<p>RW: Yes, same as all other languages.</p>
<p>BE: **?</p>
<p>MM: Want to make sure that it does the same as the built in %MathPow% and not not any overload.</p>
<p>RW: Confirm</p>
<p>DH: Wants to point out that adding syntax does have a cost. But thinks it is fine and there is a lot of precedent.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-exponentiations-operator"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-exponentiations-operator">Conclusion/Resolution</h4></a><ul>
<li>Approved for Stage 0, in 6 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#precision-of-math-trig-functions"><h2 id="precision-of-math-trig-functions">Precision of Math trig functions</h2></a><p>(Dave Herman)</p>
<p>DH: V8 made the result less exact in the name of performance. Are we going to have a &quot;race to the bottom&quot;?</p>
<p>DH: People are now starting to implement these algorithms in js since they cannot depend on the built ins.</p>
<p>DL: Java lies. Implementations do not follow the Java rules.</p>
<p>WH: Looked at the posted data and found it pretty compelling that the status quo free-for-all is not good. Some functions that should be monotonic aren't. Some results are significantly off.</p>
<p>WH: fdlibm should be the lower bar for precision. It almost always gets things exact or within 1 ulp.</p>
<p>DH: Talked to an expert (Dan Gohman) and he offered to come to this meeting; I told him he could wait and see how the conversation goes and maybe come in the future.</p>
<p>WH, DL: We need to invite experts to get the right answer to this.</p>
<p>MM: When doing the sputnik tests we just looked at the results and based the precision on what browsers did when the tests were written.</p>
<p>AWB: We need a champion.</p>
<p>DL: V8 is planning to fix this and make the results more accurate.</p>
