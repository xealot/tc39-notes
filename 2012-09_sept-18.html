<p>Introductions. Brief Agenda tweaks</p>
<p>RW: Confirm that Internationalization spec is available, per last meeting</p>
<p>NL: Internationalization specs are available on the Wiki</p>
<p>AWB: Start with Internationalization</p>
<p>IS: We need two products: The spec and a technical report (via test suite)</p>
<p>JN: Would like Internationalization tests to be included with test262</p>
<p>AWB: Finalize by June</p>

<a href="#review-and-approve-final-draft-of-internationalization-api-specification"><h2 id="review-and-approve-final-draft-of-internationalization-api-specification">Review and Approve Final Draft of Internationalization API Specification</h2></a><p>(Introduction)</p>
<p>NL: Final draft following major discussion in May and tweaks from July.</p>
<p>Primary change is to <strong>Require Normalization By Default</strong></p>
<p>DH: Is this a performance issue? Should we leave it to the lib authors</p>
<p>AWB: Why do we assume lib authors will write wrappers.</p>
<p>YK: Because we have no evidence to the contrary</p>
<p>LH: That implies a judgement about design...</p>
<p>RW: Spec APIs are not <em>bad</em>, they often require simplification for wide acceptance and use.</p>
<p>Discussion returns to whether or not Normalization is <em>required</em> by the specification or if it is implementation independant.</p>
<p>Agreement that generally there should be no &quot;optional&quot; implementation details. Conformance should be explicitly normative.</p>
<p>NL: Note about ES5 assumptions that a string has been normalized before parsed.</p>
<p>NL: Three options to support or ignore:</p>
<ol>
<li>Normalization</li>
<li>Lowercase to Uppercase first</li>
<li>Numeric sorting</li>
</ol>
<a href="#dont-use-year-0-in-datetime-formatting"><h2 id="dont-use-year-0-in-datetime-formatting">Don't Use Year 0 in Date/Time Formatting</h2></a><p>2 AD, 1 AD, 1 BC, 2 BC</p>
<p>Discussion and explanation</p>
<p>YK: Ruby has a year 0</p>
<p>AWB: Fundamentally Date/Time objects are ms mapped to some external designator, would there be any impact?</p>
<p>Decision: Date calculations will remain as is; but dates before 1AD will be adjusted in localized formatting (Date.prototype.toLocaleString, Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype.format) to reflect no year 0.</p>
<a href="#conformance-tests"><h2 id="conformance-tests">Conformance Tests</h2></a><p>NL: 137 tests, reaches almost all algorithms, coverage is still thin, draft test report</p>
<p>LH: These have been effective in identifying bugs in Chakra prototype implementation</p>
<a href="#implementors-report"><h2 id="implementors-report">Implementor's Report</h2></a><p>(Google)
NC: Chrome/v8 has <code>Intl</code> namespace and the implementation is working towards passing the conformance tests with ~20 failures. Some tests not yet implemented. Google internal use</p>
<p>AWB: What is the feedback?</p>
<p>NC: Mostly migration based discussion for the time being. There was a previously a [Localization] API.</p>
<p>AWB: Issues with name conflict? Wouldn't know if it was prefixed.</p>
<p>NC: Will be removing the prefix</p>
<p>DH/YK/STH: Discussion about globals, as they apply to the future with modules. import foo from ... will reduce naming conflict overall.</p>
<p>(Microsoft)
LH: Currently passing 100/137 of conformance tests. Dont have direct user feedback. No one is actively using the prototype.</p>
<p>RW: Is there any communication between implementors?</p>
<p>NC/LH: Only via es-discuss</p>
<p>(Mozilla)
NL: Prototyped in SpiderMonkey. Uses ICU for comparison, formatting and feature detection. JS/C++ for implementation, Unicode extensions not yet supported. Passing 128/137.</p>
<a href="#approvals"><h2 id="approvals">Approvals</h2></a><p>NL: Final change, move to year 0.</p>
<p>AWB: Need to address the &quot;optional&quot; spec issues.</p>
<p>DH: Not that leaving things unspec is evil, we should just be conservative.</p>
<p>RW: For the sake of clarity there should be a specific list,(via notes?) of &quot;optional&quot; implementation details.</p>
<p>DH: Agree, similar to the history of strict mode list</p>
<p>LH: This can be produced off-line</p>
<p>AWB: In the form of an Annex</p>
<p>DH/LH/AWB: (Discussion about implementation limitations)</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>

<a href="#approval-of-intl"><h2 id="approval-of-intl">Approval of Intl</h2></a><p>JN: If there are no objections, we will forward this document specification, ECMA-402 to the CC &amp; General Assembly for final approval.</p>
<p>...No objection.</p>
<p>JN: With the final modifcations, this document will be submitted to the CC &amp; GA for final approval. NL and NC to produce a list for an Annex of optional details.</p>
<p>JN: Any desire for ISO fast tracking?</p>
<p>(Discussion re: ISO benefits.)</p>

<p><strong>Map</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>myArray.map(callback)</li>
<li>myArray.map(depth, callback) // for an n-dimensional array</li>
<li>elementalFunction (element, index, source)</li>
<li>(need slides?)</li>
</ul>
<p>DH: Not sure that the level of technical detail is yet appropriate (from the perspective of an implementor)</p>
<p>YK: Gratuitous API changes should be avoid</p>
<p>RH: Intentionally avoided using the |thisArg|, think it's complete unnecessary and exists for legacy purpose.</p>
<p>DH: Absolutely not the case and is very important.</p>
<p>RW: For example, when you have a constructor that has properties [[Put]] via map, |thisArg| allows setting the context within the callback to the constructor itself.</p>
<p>DH: This needs to be taken offline, away from the committee.</p>
<p>LH:</p>
<p><strong>Examples of Map</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-js">paArray.map(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">element</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> element+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
});

paArray.map(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">element</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> element+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>;

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> element+<span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
});
</code></pre>
<p>LH/DH: (Discussion of explanation of River Trail semantics and the use cases)</p>
<p>LH: Is it the claim of this proposal to follow the ECMA 262 Semantics.</p>
<p>DH: Yes, up to the issue of floating point non-determinism</p>
<p>LH: Which means an engine cannot detect... (lost)</p>
<p>RH: We do rely on the programmer to know that they need to write an associative and commutative function. Tools can be provided to help.</p>
<p>LH: Worried about implicitly saying that a function does not match what ECMA 262 says it will mean.</p>
<p>DH: (Clarifies that it's <em>just</em> JavaScript)</p>
<p>BE: Parallelization can be painfully slow</p>
<p>YK: If it's straight forward, then why not specify how Parallelization is accomplished</p>
<p>DH/BE: Too early to attempt to specify Parallelization detection.</p>
<p>Lengthy discussion of Parallelization &quot;mode&quot; switching semantics... Devolved. Ended abruptly when no progress was made.</p>
<p><strong>Shape</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing 1D and 2D operations requires an understanding of shape</li>
<li>Shape determined at construction</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Identity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accessors to non leaf elements of ParallelArrays will return a fresh ParallelArray</li>
<li>References semantics for === remains consistent</li>
</ul>
<p>Between the two:</p>
<ul>
<li>pa[2] === pa[2] true for only 1D ParallelArrays</li>
<li>pa[2] === pa[2] always false when shape is &gt; 1</li>
</ul>
<p>LH: Asks for explanation...</p>
<p>DH: Will fill in blanks offline</p>
<p>AWB: Are there any other efforts that are developing competing specifications?</p>
<p>RH: Not exactly, but WebCL(Kronos?) is similar in the application they are trying to address.</p>
<p>DH: A different name?</p>
<p>BE: Vector?</p>
<p>DH: Also, the world will hate us for creating a new Array-like.</p>
<p>RW: Only a problem when creating constructors that produce objects with numeric indices and a length property and no Array proto API.</p>
<p>DH: Which it does.</p>
<p>RW: Then it will be a problem.</p>
<p>MM: The proliferation of Array-like things is unfortunate</p>
<p>RW: And ES6 reduces that pain by effectively eliminating arguments via rest and Array.from()</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>DH: There was also the idea of having parallel-specific methods.</p>
<p>Derailed to Array-like API issues on the whole... When to implement array API and when not. Why and why not...</p>

<a href="#define-properties-operator-"><h1 id="define-properties-operator-">Define Properties Operator &quot;:=&quot;</h1></a><p>(Presented by Allen Wirfs-Brock, Mozilla)</p>
<p>Introduction, rationale as published:
<a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:define_properties_operator">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:define_properties_operator</a></p>
<p>DH/AWB/RW: (discussion) Object.define, Object.put</p>
<p>RW: Have research and supporting cases from jQuery, Dojo, YUI, Node core, Underscore... Always exists an approximation of &quot;merging&quot; or &quot;extending&quot;</p>
<p>AWB: We should strive to fix the future and correct developers thinking about &quot;define&quot; and &quot;assign&quot;</p>
<p>LH: That's a dangerous scenario to put developers in, where they have to think about assignment vs definition.</p>
<p>RW: The newly created dom node case, for batch property assignment (originally brought forth by Doug) is the second most important use-case, but implicit define will pave innerHTML (or any dom node properties)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>DH: Shouldn't create syntax for the less common operation.</p>
<p>MM: Agreed.</p>
<p>AWB: But there is no way to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batch define class-side properties</li>
<li>Batch define constructor properties</li>
<li>Batch define instance properties</li>
</ul>
<p>YK: Nothing for static properties in classes yet anyway</p>
<p>MM: But not sure we need any syntax yet. If there was a lot of precedent for batch define, in the same way there is for assign/put, then it would make sense, but there is very little userland history for <em>define</em></p>
<p>RW: Agreed, assign/put is a cow-highway to pave, but user code has barely begun to include regular use of definePropert(y|ies)</p>
<p>MM: (comments about private name access concerns)</p>
<p>AWB:</p>
<p>LH: Long term, we're going to have to consider features that are allowed to move private state.</p>
<p>DH: Essentially, you'd need inside access and list private items.</p>
<p>Discussion about side channel access via newly defined properties that were never expected on the object.</p>
<p>Discussion about the needs of Private Names, Unique Names and WeakMaps.</p>
<p>BE: People want Private Names as much as they want Unique Names</p>
<p>YK: Can we tell people to use Unique Name when they want copyable and Private Name when not.</p>
<p>BE: I thought of this earlier, but wasn't sure, but it could work</p>
<p>AWB: ...</p>
<p>MM: Given ES6, remove the copying of private names, allow copying unique names: Can this be written as library code?</p>
<p>DH/YK/RW: Devs want Object.define which is Object.defineProperties
Object.assign() or Object.put() (these are the same, just different names)</p>
<p>Extensive discussion around whether or not Object.define()</p>
<p>Extensive discussion around whether or not Object.assign()</p>
<p>Derailed due to concise method's making non-enumerables, which means they won't copy if the rule disallows copying.</p>
<p>...Revisit &quot;Concise Method Definition&quot; (add anchor)</p>
<p>Object.define( target, source )</p>
<ul>
<li>All own properties of source</li>
<li>plain object descriptor map is copied</li>
<li>private names are not copied</li>
<li>unique names are copied</li>
<li>super mechanism (rebind super)</li>
</ul>
<p>Object.assign( target, source )</p>
<ul>
<li>Only enumerable own properties of source</li>
<li>Invoke [[Get]] on property list derived from source, for each property in list [[Put]] on target</li>
<li>private names are not copied</li>
<li>unique names are copied</li>
<li>super mechanism (rebind super)... AWB To determine needs</li>
<li>Returns modified &quot;target&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>DH, MM, AWB: Object.assign a well worn enough cow-path to be worth paving. Object.define isn't, and so should only be standardized after libraries have explored the space.</p>
<a href="#conclusionresolution-river-trail-intel"><h4 id="conclusionresolution-river-trail-intel">Conclusion/Resolution</h4></a><p>Accept Object.assign into ES6, but postpone Object.define (or something like it) to discussion of future versions.</p>

<a href="#concise-method-definition-revisited"><h1 id="concise-method-definition-revisited">Concise Method Definition, Revisited</h1></a><p>RW: Defaulting concise methods to non-enumerable is a mistake</p>
<p>DH: Not sure about the decision to go non-enumerable. Users expect that things they create to be enumerable and things that the platform provides to be non-enumerable.</p>
<p>LH: enumerability is not a real concept with any sort of meaning.</p>
<p>EA: (reveals the broken-ness of the DOM)</p>
<p>No longer arguable.</p>
